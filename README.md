# DevOps-A-Journey-into-Efficient-Software-Delivery

The world of software development and operations is constantly evolving, and as a lifelong learner, I recently enrolled in a comprehensive DevOps course to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. Over the course duration, I delved into various topics that have revolutionized the way we build, deploy, and manage software applications.

In this blog post, firstly I will share my key takeaways and insights from the DevOps course, covering everything from virtual machines to GitOps. Then I will give a little insight about some practical demonstrations & blogs that I wrote on topics that I covered throughout the course.
